/*
 * AppMon Server REST API
 * The AppMon Server exposes management and integration functionality via REST endpoints. This interactive documentation also acts as a REST client you can use to interact with the AppMon Server.  The HTTP status code of the response shows the result of your request. The expected response code for a successful request is documented individually per REST endpoint. Additionally the following error response codes can typically occur in our REST interface:  * **400** - Bad Request: Some request parameters are not correct. * **401** - Unauthorized: A valid authorization header (Basic Authentication) is required but is not available. * **403** - Forbidden: Execution of request is not allowed, e.g. the user has no privileges. * **404** - Not Found: Endpoint does not exist or some entities could not be found, e.g. System Profile. * **500** - Internal Server Error: See response body for details.  Additional [usage examples](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/doc/appmon70/shortlink/id_server_rest_examples) can be found in the AppMon documentation.
